# Morphology documentation
This repository contains the documentation of the morphology files formats used by Blue Brain. The representations divide into two main topological categories:
* tree-like representation (neurons, astrocytes)
* graph-like representation (vasculature)

To update the documentation, update the rst files located in the source directory.
To update the version number, modify the "version" entry in package.json
